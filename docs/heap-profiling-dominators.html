<h1>Finding Accumulation Points</h1>


<script type="text/javascript" src="//developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/heap-profiling-dominators-files/script.js"></script>

<p>This page demonstrates how accumulation points can be detected
using the Heap
Profiler.</p>

<p>Below is the source code of the script, for reference:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function CollectionItem(s)
{
  this.s = s;
}

function Collection()
{
  this.items = [];
}

Collection.prototype = {
  add: function(item)
  {
    this.items.push(item);
  },

  item: function(index)
  {
    return this.items[index];
  }
}

function createCollection(count)
{
  var collection = new Collection();
  for (var i = 0; i < count; ++i)
    collection.add(new CollectionItem(i.toString()));
  return collection;
}

var holder1 = [createCollection(10000), createCollection(15000)];
var holder2 = [holder1[0]];

</pre>

<p>Using the <strong>Dominators</strong> view, it's easy to spot
collection objects that are small by themselves but retain lots of
memory.  In the <strong>Dominators</strong> view, find the
<code>DOMWindows</code> node (usually, the topmost one) and expand
it. Look at the top two child nodes (by default nodes are sorted
by their retained size). The first one is a system wrapper
around the <code>holder1</code> array. The second one is the
<code>Collection</code> node. Both of them have
small shallow size, but big retained size, due to a fact that
they hold lots of <code>CollectionItem</code>
objects.</p>

<p>Note that the <strong>Dominators</strong> reveals dependencies
between objects, not their references. For example, one of
the <code>Collection</code> objects is shared between two arrays, thus
it is not retained by any of them, but by the <code>DOMWindows</code>
object.</p>

<p>To see, how an object is actually referenced, click on it, and
  look at the lower panel that shows retaining paths.</p>
